# ðŸ§¬ "My" genome

This repo holds my [SNP genotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNP_genotyping) patch, as measured by [23andMe](https://www.23andme.com).

## Me

In my 30s, generally healthy, diagnosed with both [ASD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum) and [ADHD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder), and always had full [aphantasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia).

## Why open-source my DNA?

- Maybe it helps someone, and I guess it's mine to open-source.
- I'm not planning on becoming a criminal, and I've already shared it with DNA testing companies that sell it and make it available to law enforcement.
- I don't think I'll be discriminated against based on it (and if it happens it's a dodged bullet, so good for me).
- I think I'll die long before DNA will both become a trusted authentication method and something that can be faked.
- I don't think this can affect any health / life insurance I might want to get.
- If anyone wants to get my DNA in real life, they can easily do that from a cup or the [air](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1875176822001068).
- I won't click a [phishing link](https://haax.fr/en/writeups/inter-iut-2020/osint_se_challenge/#dna-sequence-and-personnality) if you send me an email about blueberries.
